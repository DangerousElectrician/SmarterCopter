All design ideas must incorporate the use three different TI devices, integrated circuits (“ICs”) and a TI processor. Analog ICs must come from the following categories: 
(i) data converters; 
(ii) amplifiers; 
(iii) power management devices; 
(iv) interface devices;  
(v) switches; 
(vi) RF devices; 
(vii) temperature sensors; 
(viii) clocks and timers; and 
(ix) comparators. All TI processors are accepted. Other TI devices may be incorporated into the design, but only those integrated circuits in the categories above will be counted toward the IC Requirements.

Power management
	Regulated 2.8v power
		Lipo battery is as high as 4.3 and low as 3.0 loaded
		LDO or switcher?
	battery management
		*Single cell lipo 160 mAh 
			Different mAh might be used

				Really cheap
			Does this battery use a JST-XH or Parkzone Pico connector?
		no charging circuitry onboard
			Make battery removable and charge outside helicopter
		*1.8 amp current draw average more current draw peak
		keep battery happy
			battery voltage limits
		gas gauge if easy
		Current limiting?
			high peak current draw from motors may cause issues

Sensing
	9-dof Invensense gyro/accel/compass/ MPU-9250 MPU-6050
	MS5611 barometer get from newark

Communication
	radio
		low power bluetooth
		xbee
		zigbee
		wifi
	Radio microcontroller SoC

Processor
	2.8v
	i2c
	freertos?
	pins
		i2c	2
		motpwm	4
		uart	2

Motor drivers
	tail rotor
		DRV8837DSGR
			single full h bridge
			8-wfdfn
	main rotor
		mosfet
			pmv31xn
			bsh108
		mosfet array to save space
			SIA910EDJ-T1-GE3
				feels weird, seems too small for power
