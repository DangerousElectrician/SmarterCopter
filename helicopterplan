All design ideas must incorporate the use three different TI devices, integrated circuits (“ICs”) and a TI processor. Analog ICs must come from the following categories: 
(i) data converters; 
(ii) amplifiers; 
(iii) power management devices; 
(iv) interface devices;  
(v) switches; 
(vi) RF devices; 
(vii) temperature sensors; 
(viii) clocks and timers; and 
(ix) comparators. All TI processors are accepted. Other TI devices may be incorporated into the design, but only those integrated circuits in the categories above will be counted toward the IC Requirements.

Low cost main board replacement for syma 107g helicopter

Power management
	Regulated 2.8v power
		Lipo battery is as high as 4.3 and low as 3.0 loaded
		LDO or switcher?
	battery management
		Requirements
			Must keep battery happy
			Voltage limits
		*Single cell lipo 160 mAh 
			Different mAh might be used
			http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=11893
				Really cheap
			Does this battery use a JST-XH or Parkzone Pico connector?
		no charging circuitry onboard
			Make battery removable and charge outside helicopter
		*1.8 amp current draw average more current draw peak
		gas gauge if easy
		Current limiting?
			high peak current draw from motors may cause issues
		report to microcontroller
			i2c
			power good
			analog voltage
