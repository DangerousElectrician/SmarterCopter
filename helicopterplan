All design ideas must incorporate the use three different TI devices, integrated circuits (“ICs”) and a TI processor. Analog ICs must come from the following categories: 
(i) data converters; 
(ii) amplifiers; 
(iii) power management devices; 
(iv) interface devices;  
(v) switches; 
(vi) RF devices; 
(vii) temperature sensors; 
(viii) clocks and timers; and 
(ix) comparators. All TI processors are accepted. Other TI devices may be incorporated into the design, but only those integrated circuits in the categories above will be counted toward the IC Requirements.

Low cost main board replacement for syma 107g helicopter

Power management
	Regulated 2.8v power
		Lipo battery is as high as 4.3 and low as 3.0 loaded
		LDO or switcher?
	battery management
		Requirements
			Must keep battery happy
			Voltage limits
		*Single cell lipo 160 mAh 
			Different mAh might be used
			http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=11893
				Really cheap
			Does this battery use a JST-XH or Parkzone Pico connector?
		no charging circuitry onboard
			Make battery removable and charge outside helicopter
		*1.8 amp current draw average more current draw peak
		gas gauge if easy
		Current limiting?
			high peak current draw from motors may cause issues
		report to microcontroller
			i2c
			power good
			analog voltage

Sensing
	9-dof Invensense gyro/accel/compass/ MPU-9250 MPU-6050
		16 bit adc
		gyro ranges: 250,500,1000,2000 deg/s
		accel ranges: 2,4,8,16 g
		mag ranges: 14 bit (0.6µT/LSB) or 16 bit (15µT/LSB) 
		has proprietary digital motion processor
		can perform basic 6-axis sensor fusion
	LSM330 6-dof
		gyro: 250,500,2000 deg/s
		acc: 2,4,6,8,16 g
	MS5611 barometer get from newark

Communication
	radio
		low power bluetooth - wins on googlefight, star network, first look appears easy to set up 
		zigbee - supports mesh network, feels more difficult to set up
		wifi - bitrate overkill for just controlling helicopter, capable of video stream
	Radio microcontroller SoC
	antenna size

Processor
	Requirements
		Wireless communication
		Stablility
		Read sensors
		PWM motors
	2.8v
	*i2c - need for sensors
	freertos?
	cyclic executive?
	pins
		*i2c	2
		*motpwm	4
		uart	2
		*6 gpio minimum
	CC3200
		simplelink wifi
		9mmx9mm - too big to fit on copter mainboard, can be hung outside though
		ARM Cortex-M4 @ 80MHz
	CC2540
		low energy bluetooth
                6mmx6mm
                8051 @ 32 MHz
                has USB peripheral instead of i2c
	*CC2541 - I like this one the best
		low energy bluetooth
		6mmx6mm
		8051 @ 32 MHz
		has i2c peripheral
		128 or 256 KB flash
		2v-3.6v supply
	CC2530
		zigbee
		6mmx6mm QFN40
		8051
		no i2c
	CC2533 - I also like this
		zigbee
		6mmx6mm
		8051
		64 or 96 KB flash - less memory than CC2541
		2v-3.6v supply
		
Motor drivers
	tail rotor
		DRV8837DSGR
			single full h bridge
			8-wfdfn
		BD621
	main rotor
		mosfet
			pmv31xn
			bsh108
		mosfet array to save space
			SIA910EDJ-T1-GE3
				feels weird, seems too small for power
